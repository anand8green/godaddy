# Problem

Please create a simple React application that lists our public GitHub repositories, where clicking one of the repositories in the list takes the user to a page containing additional details about that particular repository. You are welcome to use whatever libraries you'd like, but no need to over-engineer this - a simple solution is entirely appropriate here, we're just looking to get a sense of how you approach the problem and structure your solution.

Details:

You can get a list of our public repositories via this URL.
For the additional details page, please display at least the following data about the repository:
title
description
link to the repo on GitHub
language(s) in the repo
forks, open issues, watchers
The solution should include some basic tests, bonus points for making it look nice.

# Solution

I have created this app using Typescript, React, Styled it with plain CSS and written Test cases using React Testing Library.
For navigation I used React-Router-Dom but for anything else I avoided adding any extra library to keep the app small and also demonstrate my skills set.
